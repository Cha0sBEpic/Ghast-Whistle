# GhastWhistle

## Overview

GhastWhistle is a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft servers that allows players to call their Happy Ghast using a Ghast Whistle (Goat Horn). This plugin enables players to link themselves to a Happy Ghast, which can then be summoned and follow the player, offering a better way to interact with the Happy Ghast.

## Features

-   **Ghast Linking:** Players can link to a Happy Ghast by equipping a harness. Once linked, the ghast will recognize the player as its owner.
-   **Ghast Summoning:** Players can use a Ghast Whistle to summon their linked Happy Ghast. The ghast will fly to the player and follow them around.
-   **Following Behavior:** When a player holds the Ghast Whistle, their linked Happy Ghast will actively follow them, making it easier to keep the ghast nearby.
